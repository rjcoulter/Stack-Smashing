Notes on "Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit" by Aleph One

Introduction
- Explain what buffer overflows are and how they work
- Buffer -> Contiguous block of computer memory that holds multiple
  instances of some data type, associated with word buffer
  arrays
- Arrays can be either static or dynamic
  - Stacic -> allocated at load time on data segment
  - Dynamic -> allocated at run time on the stack
- We are concered only with overflows of dynamic buffers, ie 
  stack-based buffer overflows
